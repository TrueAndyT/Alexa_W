# Project Status Summary
*Last Updated: August 15, 2025*

## ✅ Completed Refactoring

### Project Organization
- **Services**: All service files moved to flat structure in `services/` directory
  - `services/loader_service.py`
  - `services/logger_service.py`
  - `services/kwd_service.py`
  - `services/stt_service.py`
  - `services/llm_service.py`
  - `services/tts_service.py`
- **Tests**: All test files organized in `tests/` directory
- **Logs**: All log files centralized in `logs/` directory
- **Documentation**: All docs moved to `docs/` directory

### Path Updates
- All import paths updated to reflect flattened service structure
- `manage_services.py` updated with correct service paths
- `loader_service.py` updated with correct service paths
- Log file outputs directed to `logs/` directory

## 🚧 Known Issues

### Critical
1. **LLM Service gRPC Handler Issue**
   - **Problem**: The LLM service starts successfully but the Complete RPC handler is never invoked when requests are sent
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - Service shows as SERVING in health checks
     - No `[MESSAGE RECEIVED]` logs when requests are sent
     - Requests timeout after 10 seconds
   - **Investigation Done**:
     - Confirmed Ollama server is running
     - Verified service registration order is correct
     - Checked IP address binding (127.0.0.1)
     - Confirmed gRPC servicer is added before server starts
   - **Status**: Needs further debugging

### Minor
1. **IP Address Masking**: Some files may still show masked IP addresses (*********)
2. **VRAM Management**: Total usage ~8GB with all models loaded - needs optimization

## ✅ Working Components

### Services
- **Loader Service**: Orchestrates all services, manages startup sequence
- **Logger Service**: Centralized logging with dialog tracking
- **KWD Service**: Wake word detection with "Alexa" trigger
- **STT Service**: Speech-to-text with Whisper model
- **TTS Service**: Text-to-speech with Kokoro

### Features
- Health check system for all services
- Dialog management with unique IDs
- 4-second follow-up timer
- Phased startup sequence
- VRAM pre-loading for models
- Graceful shutdown handling

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Ports**: 5001-5006 for services
- **IP Binding**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
- **VRAM Requirement**: 7640MB minimum
- **Models**:
  - Wake Word: alexa_v0.1.onnx
  - STT: Whisper small.en
  - LLM: llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M
  - TTS: Kokoro af_heart

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Working Tests
- Individual service tests (`test_kwd.py`, `test_stt.py`, `test_tts.py`)
- Interactive tests (`test_1_kwd_interactive.py` through `test_4_tts_interactive.py`)
- VRAM monitoring tests

### Failing Tests
- `test_llm_debug.py` - Due to gRPC handler issue
- Full chain tests - Blocked by LLM issue

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix LLM gRPC Handler Issue**
   - Debug why the Complete RPC is not being invoked
   - Check proto file compilation
   - Verify servicer registration

2. **Complete Integration Testing**
   - Once LLM is fixed, run full chain tests
   - Validate end-to-end flow

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize VRAM usage
   - Tune model loading times
   - Improve streaming latency

4. **Documentation**
   - Update all test files to use correct paths
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Create deployment guide

## 💻 Development Environment

- **Python**: 3.11 with virtual environment
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **GPU**: NVIDIA with CUDA support
- **OS**: Linux Mint
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB VRAM

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start everything
python manage_services.py start loader

# Check status
python manage_services.py status

# View logs
tail -f logs/loader_service.log

# Stop everything
python manage_services.py stop all
```

## 📝 Notes

- All services use gRPC for communication
- Services bind to localhost only for security
- Ollama must be running for LLM service
- Audio device configuration may need adjustment per system
